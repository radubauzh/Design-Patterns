### What is a Design Pattern?

A Design Pattern is a pattern that captures a solution to a recurring design problem
• It is not a pattern for implementation problems
• It is not a ready-made solution that has to be applied
A design pattern is a description of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.
A design pattern is a kind of blueprint
Consists of different parts
• All of these parts make up the pattern!
• When we talk about the pattern we therefore mean all of these parts together (not only the class diagram..)
